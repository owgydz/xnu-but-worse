## What is XNU But Worse?

XNU, but Worse, is a small team of friends that wanted to maintain a kernel, but we have absolutely no experience in making fully-functioning kernels, but we decided to do so and said "screw it." 

## Expectations
Do *NOT* expect this software to be as good as current XNU versions. They not like us (Kendrick Lamar reference. Anyone else watch the Superbowl?). But anyways, this might suck.

## For the nerds
Want to be such a cool dude? Want to feel higher than everyone else? Want to be a nerdy boy? Read `XNU.md` for more info about the Kernel. This was migrated from the fork. It's Apple's documentation.

## Contribute

Ok, this is how you become a cool guy. If you actually know kernel stuff, go ahead and contribute. It's not like it's hurting us (I hope so).
